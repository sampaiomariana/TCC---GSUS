## Proposal 

The system in question has a software system that monitors medications at the health in order to identify medication shortages and prevent shortages of these
medicines for the citizen. It also allows the citizen to verify if the medicine he needs is available at the health center or if he only is available at pharmacies.
The focus is that we have two main actors who would use the system, being the citizen and the manager of the health post.

•The citizen corresponds to the citizen who has an interest in obtaining this information from home, via the internet and can consult the system without having to go to the health post. This citizen can be either an adult or an elderly person, the needs you have for him to be able to use the system is that he is over 18 years old and can have access to the internet.

•The manager of the health post corresponds to a person at the post who can be in charge of administering the post. For this software system the your need is essential because this manager is the one who performs the registration of drugs or any drug changes in the system and that information is made available to the citizen.
